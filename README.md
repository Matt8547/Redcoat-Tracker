Issue- 3 RHA JTAC's were having difficulty recording currency controls on the go, the current system uses an excell spreadsheet hosted on a server that is only available on company devices and often fails. 

Solution, create an Android app that can be utilised to log currency controls while deployed to update the system on return. Must be easy to use and if possible, notify the user when a discipline is about to expire.

This is the initial start of a light weight JTAC currency tracking app specificaly for 3 RHA JTAC's. 
I have added storage to retain input disciplines when app is reset using (Rooms). This was difficult and i kept getting issues with Kotlin mismatch and plugin errors. finaly solved with AI assistance.
initial testing is positive and the app works well, next modifications will be to make it look better.

Users will need to allow unknown app locations to permit the app to install.
Users must allow permissions for notifications to come through
